# Project Purpose
## Learning Outcomes
Taken from Assessment Handbook provided by Code Institute.


### Project requirements
Taken from Assessment Handbook provided by Code Institute or derived therefrom.
- Required langauge: [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) 
- Using APIs and library software [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)
- Deploy to a cloud-based platform [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)


# Initial planning
### Initial plan
- In the intial meeting there was three ideas. Recipe website, Garden blog and Car Dealship. Two rough wireframes where created.
#
Wireframe 1                                         | Wireframe 2

#
### Plan
- it was decided to build a Garden blog, so a rough sketch of a garden blog with inspiration from existing blogs where made. 
  Please visit [credits to see the inspiration used](/credits.md)

 Home Page                                            | Blogpost page

# Credits

## Thank you
- [Spencer Barriball](https://github.com/5pence) for always being there and being a fantastic mentor.
- [Daisy McGirr](https://github.com/Daisy-McG) for helping me and giving me insights into backend cooperation with frontend, helping me with some debugs and lessons around django.
- [Bim Williams](https://github.com/MrBim) for being a good person to talk, and for supplying link to API to render content into a downloadable PDF.

### Content credits
- This project is modelled and followed using the "I Think Therefore I Blog" [walkthrough](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FST101+2021_T1/courseware/b31493372e764469823578613d11036b/fe4299adcd6743328183aab4e7ec5d13/), produced by Matt Rudge at Code Institute. Using this allowed me to focus on understanding the concepts instead of inventing the wheel with every line of code I produce.
- Another source used in this project is [Djanogcentral](https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/). Wherever code from this walkthrough is used, there is credit given in that file.
- To upload multiple images I took a lot of inspiration from a content creator on Youtube called [The Pylot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0nYBqY9i5w), my code is not a copy paste of his, but I used his video as a stepping stone to get functionality for my Carousels. I also used docs from [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/django_image_and_video_upload).
- For the alt_tags a line of code from a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65415221/best-method-to-store-alt-tags-in-django) was used.

### Media
- For how to make the README nav-bar https://github.com/artkonekt/menu/blob/master/README.md was used.
- As template for README https://github.com/mikakallberg/readme-template/blob/master/README.md was used.
