# Credits

## Thank you
- [Spencer Barriball](https://github.com/5pence) for always being there and being a fantastic mentor.
- [Daisy McGirr](https://github.com/Daisy-McG) for helping me and giving me insights into backend cooperation with frontend, helping me with some debugs and lessons around django.
- [Bim Williams](https://github.com/MrBim) for being a good person to talk, and for supplying link to API to render content into a downloadable PDF.

### Content
- This project is modelled and followed using the "I Think Therefore I Blog" [walkthrough](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FST101+2021_T1/courseware/b31493372e764469823578613d11036b/fe4299adcd6743328183aab4e7ec5d13/), produced by Matt Rudge at Code Institute. Using this allowed me to focus on understanding the concepts instead of inventing the wheel with every line of code I produce.
- Another source used in this project is [Djanogcentral](https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/). Wherever code from this walkthrough is used, there is credit given in that file.

### Media
- For how to make the README nav-bar https://github.com/artkonekt/menu/blob/master/README.md was used.
- As template for README https://github.com/mikakallberg/readme-template/blob/master/README.md was used.
